Component,Alarm Name,Metric Name,Statistic,Threshold,Period (seconds),Evaluation Periods,Datapoints to Alarm,Severity,Reasoning
EKS Control Plane,API Authentication Failures,EKS-API-AuthFailures (Metric Filter),Sum,> 50 failures,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"Authentication failures indicate IAM misconfiguration, expired credentials, or unauthorized access attempts. Control plane logs filter pattern: responseStatus.code >= 400 for authentication verb. Threshold 50 per 5 min distinguishes legitimate config errors from attacks. Requires control plane audit logs enabled."
EKS Control Plane,API 5xx Errors,EKS-API-ServerErrors (Metric Filter),Sum,> 100 errors,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"API server 5xx errors indicate control plane degradation, etcd issues, or API server overload. Direct service impact - kubectl commands fail, controllers cannot reconcile. Threshold 100 per 5 min for typical cluster API load. Immediate investigation required as indicates control plane health issues."
EKS Control Plane,Scheduler Failures,EKS-Scheduler-Failures (Metric Filter),Sum,> 10 failures,300,3,3,P2-High,"Scheduler cannot place pods due to insufficient resources, taints/tolerations mismatches, or node affinity constraints. Filter pattern: ""failed to schedule"". Threshold 10 per 5 min indicates sustained scheduling issues. 3 periods (15 min) confirms persistent capacity or constraint problems requiring node scaling or policy adjustment."
EKS Control Plane,Forbidden API Attempts (403),EKS-API-Forbidden (Metric Filter),Sum,> 20 attempts,300,2,2,P2-High,"403 Forbidden indicates RBAC permission denials. Sustained 403s may indicate misconfigured service accounts, incorrect ClusterRole bindings, or security probing. Threshold 20 per 5 min balances normal RBAC denials vs. systematic issues requiring investigation. Audit for security events."
EKS Control Plane,Controller Manager Errors,EKS-Controller-Errors (Metric Filter),Sum,> 50 errors,300,3,2,P2-High,"Controller manager errors affect resource reconciliation (Deployments, ReplicaSets, Services). Filter pattern varies by controller type. Threshold 50 per 5 min for typical cluster with 100s of resources. 2/3 datapoints confirms sustained controller issues vs. transient failures during rolling updates."
