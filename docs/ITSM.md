Here is the documentation for sending AWS EKS cluster data to a CMDB:

To integrate your AWS EKS cluster with a CMDB/ITSM database, you can use either a push or a pull mechanism. Below are two options detailing how to achieve this.

### **Option 1: Push Method - Using GitOps and a CI/CD Pipeline**

This approach involves using a GitOps workflow to automatically push data from your EKS cluster to the CMDB whenever there are changes.

**Overview:**

In this model, a CI/CD pipeline is triggered by changes in your Kubernetes manifests or a scheduled job. This pipeline runs a script that extracts the necessary data from your EKS cluster (namespaces, pods, CRDs) and then formats and sends this data to your CMDB's API.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An AWS EKS cluster.
    *   A Git repository (like AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or GitLab) to store your Kubernetes manifests and scripts.
    *   A CI/CD tool (like AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitLab CI).
    *   A CMDB that exposes an API for creating and updating configuration items (CIs).
    *   `kubectl` and AWS CLI configured in your CI/CD environment.

2.  **Create an Extraction Script:**
    *   Develop a script (e.g., in Python or Bash) that uses `kubectl` commands to get the required information from your EKS cluster.
    *   **Namespaces:** `kubectl get namespaces -o json`
    *   **Pods:** `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json`
    *   **CRDs:** `kubectl get crds -o json` and for custom resources: `kubectl get <crd-name> --all-namespaces -o json`
    *   The script should parse the JSON output to extract relevant fields (e.g., pod name, namespace, labels, annotations, status for pods).

3.  **Format and Push Data to CMDB:**
    *   The script will then transform the extracted data into the format expected by your CMDB's API.
    *   Use an HTTP client (like `curl` or Python's `requests` library) to make API calls to your CMDB to create or update CIs.
    *   Handle authentication with the CMDB API, often using API keys or OAuth tokens stored securely (e.g., in AWS Secrets Manager).

4.  **Set up the CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Configure your CI/CD tool to trigger the pipeline. This can be done in two ways:
        *   **Event-Driven:** Trigger the pipeline on every push to your Git repository that changes the state of your cluster.
        *   **Scheduled:** Run the pipeline on a regular schedule (e.g., every hour) to ensure the CMDB is up-to-date.
    *   The pipeline will check out the repository, run the extraction script, and push the data to the CMDB.

5.  **IAM Roles and Permissions:**
    *   Ensure your CI/CD pipeline has an IAM role with the necessary permissions to access the EKS cluster.

### **Option 2: Pull Method - Using a Kubernetes Operator or a Monitoring Agent**

This approach involves deploying an agent or operator within your EKS cluster that periodically queries the Kubernetes API and sends the data to your CMDB.

**Overview:**

A dedicated pod running in your cluster will be responsible for monitoring the cluster's state. It will then communicate this information to the CMDB. This is often a more scalable and Kubernetes-native way to handle this task.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An AWS EKS cluster.
    *   A CMDB with an accessible API.
    *   A containerized application (the "agent" or "operator") that can run inside the cluster.

2.  **Develop or Deploy a CMDB Integration Agent:**
    *   **Custom Operator:** You can build a Kubernetes operator using the Operator SDK or Kubebuilder. This operator would watch for changes to pods, namespaces, and CRDs in real-time. When a change is detected, it would automatically make an API call to the CMDB.
    *   **Third-Party Tools:** Many monitoring and observability platforms (like Datadog, Dynatrace, or ServiceNow Discovery) have agents that can be deployed to Kubernetes. These agents often have built-in CMDB integration capabilities. You would deploy their agent (usually as a DaemonSet or Deployment) to your EKS cluster.

3.  **Agent Configuration:**
    *   Configure the agent with the endpoint and credentials for your CMDB. This is typically done via a ConfigMap or a Secret in Kubernetes.

4.  **RBAC and Service Accounts:**
    *   Create a `ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` for your agent. This will grant it the necessary permissions to list and watch the resources (pods, namespaces, CRDs) it needs to monitor across the entire cluster.

    *   **Example `ClusterRole`:**
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRole
        metadata:
          name: cmdb-agent-role
        rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        - apiGroups: ["*"] # Or specify the API groups for your CRDs
          resources: ["*"] # Or specify your custom resource kinds
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        ```

5.  **Deploy the Agent:**
    *   Deploy the agent or operator to your EKS cluster using a Deployment or DaemonSet manifest.

6.  **Data Synchronization:**
    *   The agent will run continuously, polling the Kubernetes API server for changes or receiving real-time updates. It will then handle the logic of creating, updating, or deleting CIs in your CMDB based on the state of the EKS cluster.
