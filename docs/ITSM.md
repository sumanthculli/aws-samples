Here is the documentation for sending AWS EKS cluster data to a CMDB:

To integrate your AWS EKS cluster with a CMDB/ITSM database, you can use either a push or a pull mechanism. Below are two options detailing how to achieve this.

### **Option 1: Push Method - Using GitOps and a CI/CD Pipeline**

This approach involves using a GitOps workflow to automatically push data from your EKS cluster to the CMDB whenever there are changes.

**Overview:**

In this model, a CI/CD pipeline is triggered by changes in your Kubernetes manifests or a scheduled job. This pipeline runs a script that extracts the necessary data from your EKS cluster (namespaces, pods, CRDs) and then formats and sends this data to your CMDB's API.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An AWS EKS cluster.
    *   A Git repository (like AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or GitLab) to store your Kubernetes manifests and scripts.
    *   A CI/CD tool (like AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitLab CI).
    *   A CMDB that exposes an API for creating and updating configuration items (CIs).
    *   `kubectl` and AWS CLI configured in your CI/CD environment.

2.  **Create an Extraction Script:**
    *   Develop a script (e.g., in Python or Bash) that uses `kubectl` commands to get the required information from your EKS cluster.
    *   **Namespaces:** `kubectl get namespaces -o json`
    *   **Pods:** `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json`
    *   **CRDs:** `kubectl get crds -o json` and for custom resources: `kubectl get <crd-name> --all-namespaces -o json`
    *   The script should parse the JSON output to extract relevant fields (e.g., pod name, namespace, labels, annotations, status for pods).

3.  **Format and Push Data to CMDB:**
    *   The script will then transform the extracted data into the format expected by your CMDB's API.
    *   Use an HTTP client (like `curl` or Python's `requests` library) to make API calls to your CMDB to create or update CIs.
    *   Handle authentication with the CMDB API, often using API keys or OAuth tokens stored securely (e.g., in AWS Secrets Manager).

4.  **Set up the CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Configure your CI/CD tool to trigger the pipeline. This can be done in two ways:
        *   **Event-Driven:** Trigger the pipeline on every push to your Git repository that changes the state of your cluster.
        *   **Scheduled:** Run the pipeline on a regular schedule (e.g., every hour) to ensure the CMDB is up-to-date.
    *   The pipeline will check out the repository, run the extraction script, and push the data to the CMDB.

5.  **IAM Roles and Permissions:**
    *   Ensure your CI/CD pipeline has an IAM role with the necessary permissions to access the EKS cluster.

### **Option 2: Pull Method - Using a Kubernetes Operator or a Monitoring Agent**

This approach involves deploying an agent or operator within your EKS cluster that periodically queries the Kubernetes API and sends the data to your CMDB.

**Overview:**

A dedicated pod running in your cluster will be responsible for monitoring the cluster's state. It will then communicate this information to the CMDB. This is often a more scalable and Kubernetes-native way to handle this task.

**High-Level Steps:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An AWS EKS cluster.
    *   A CMDB with an accessible API.
    *   A containerized application (the "agent" or "operator") that can run inside the cluster.

2.  **Develop or Deploy a CMDB Integration Agent:**
    *   **Custom Operator:** You can build a Kubernetes operator using the Operator SDK or Kubebuilder. This operator would watch for changes to pods, namespaces, and CRDs in real-time. When a change is detected, it would automatically make an API call to the CMDB.
    *   **Third-Party Tools:** Many monitoring and observability platforms (like Datadog, Dynatrace, or ServiceNow Discovery) have agents that can be deployed to Kubernetes. These agents often have built-in CMDB integration capabilities. You would deploy their agent (usually as a DaemonSet or Deployment) to your EKS cluster.

3.  **Agent Configuration:**
    *   Configure the agent with the endpoint and credentials for your CMDB. This is typically done via a ConfigMap or a Secret in Kubernetes.

4.  **RBAC and Service Accounts:**
    *   Create a `ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` for your agent. This will grant it the necessary permissions to list and watch the resources (pods, namespaces, CRDs) it needs to monitor across the entire cluster.

    *   **Example `ClusterRole`:**
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRole
        metadata:
          name: cmdb-agent-role
        rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        - apiGroups: ["*"] # Or specify the API groups for your CRDs
          resources: ["*"] # Or specify your custom resource kinds
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
        ```

5.  **Deploy the Agent:**
    *   Deploy the agent or operator to your EKS cluster using a Deployment or DaemonSet manifest.

6.  **Data Synchronization:**
    *   The agent will run continuously, polling the Kubernetes API server for changes or receiving real-time updates. It will then handle the logic of creating, updating, or deleting CIs in your CMDB based on the state of the EKS cluster.


Yes, it is absolutely possible for a CMDB system to directly invoke the EKS cluster's API endpoints to retrieve information about pods, namespaces, and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This is a "pull" model where the CMDB is the active component initiating the data collection.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how this can be achieved:

### **How It Works: The Big Picture**

1.  **API Endpoint Exposure**: By default, the Amazon EKS cluster API server has a public endpoint that is accessible from the internet. You can also configure private access to keep all communication within your VPC.
2.  **Authentication**: Your CMDB system needs to authenticate with the EKS API server. Since direct username/password authentication isn't the standard, EKS leverages AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure authentication. The primary mechanism for this is **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**.
3.  **Authorization**: Once authenticated, the CMDB system's requests are subject to Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This means you need to grant the specific IAM role the necessary permissions within the Kubernetes cluster to read the required resources.
4.  **API Invocation**: With authentication and authorization in place, the CMDB system can make standard RESTful API calls to the specific Kubernetes API endpoints for namespaces, pods, and CRDs.

### **Steps to Implement This Pull Model**

Here is a step-by-step guide to setting this up:

#### **Step 1: Configure EKS API Server Endpoint Access**

*   **Public Access**: By default, your EKS cluster's API server has a public endpoint. For enhanced security, you should restrict access to this endpoint to specific IP addresses, such as the outbound IP of your CMDB system.
*   **Private Access**: For a more secure setup, you can enable private endpoint access. This means the API server is only accessible from within the cluster's VPC. If your CMDB is outside of this VPC, you would need to set up a connection through a bastion host, VPN, or AWS PrivateLink.

#### **Step 2: Set Up Authentication via IAM**

The most secure and recommended method is to use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).

1.  **Create an IAM OIDC Provider for your Cluster**: If you don't already have one, you need to create an OIDC identity provider for your EKS cluster. This allows your cluster to receive OIDC JSON web tokens for authentication.
2.  **Create an IAM Role**: Create an IAM role that your CMDB system will assume.
3.  **Establish Trust**: Configure the IAM role's trust relationship to allow a specific IAM user (representing your CMDB) to assume this role.

#### **Step 3: Grant Permissions with Kubernetes RBAC**

Your CMDB needs permission to read resources inside the Kubernetes cluster.

1.  **Create a `ClusterRole`**: Define a `ClusterRole` in Kubernetes that grants read-only access to the desired resources.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: cmdb-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
      resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    - apiGroups: ["*"] # Or specify the API groups of your CRDs
      resources: ["*"] # Or specify your custom resource kinds
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    ```

2.  **Create a `ClusterRoleBinding`**: Bind the `ClusterRole` to the IAM role you created. You will need to map the IAM role to a Kubernetes user or group in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap in the `kube-system` namespace.

#### **Step 4: CMDB Invocation of EKS API**

Your CMDB system can now make authenticated API calls.

1.  **Generate a Token**: The CMDB system, using the credentials of its IAM user, will assume the designated IAM role and then generate a token by calling the AWS STS (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`) or by using the AWS CLI (`aws eks get-token`). This token will be used as a bearer token in the API requests.
2.  **Make API Calls**: The CMDB can then make standard HTTPS GET requests to the Kubernetes API endpoints.
    *   **List all namespaces**: `GET /api/v1/namespaces`
    *   **List all pods in all namespaces**: `GET /api/v1/pods`
    *   **List all CRDs**: `GET /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions`
    *   **List all instances of a specific CRD**: `GET /apis/<group>/<version>/<crd-plural-name>`

### **Considerations for this Approach**

*   **Network Security**: You must have a secure network path from your CMDB to the EKS API server. Using a private endpoint and AWS PrivateLink is the most secure option.
*   **Credential Management**: The initial IAM user credentials that the CMDB uses to assume the role must be managed securely.
*   **API Throttling**: Be mindful of the rate at which your CMDB polls the API server to avoid performance issues.
*   **Complexity**: This method requires a good understanding of both AWS IAM and Kubernetes RBAC.

Some CMDBs, like ServiceNow, have specific connectors (e.g., Service Graph Connector for AWS) that can automate much of this process, often using a bastion host to run `kubectl` commands.
