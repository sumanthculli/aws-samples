Component,Alarm Name,Metric Name,Statistic,Threshold,Period (seconds),Evaluation Periods,Datapoints to Alarm,Severity,Reasoning
PrivateLink,ActiveConnections (Endpoint Service),ActiveConnections,Anomaly Detection,LessThanLowerThreshold (6 std dev),300,3,3,P2-High,"Anomaly detection for stable workloads with predictable traffic. Lower threshold detects unexpected drops (service outage, endpoint connectivity failure). Upper threshold detects unusual spikes (traffic anomaly, security event). 6 std dev balances sensitivity for production environments."
PrivateLink,EndpointsCount,EndpointsCount,Minimum,< expected endpoint count,300,2,2,P2-High,"For critical shared services (ECR, S3 endpoints, internal APIs), monitors number of consumer VPC endpoints connected. Drop below expected count indicates endpoint deletion, connectivity failure, or consumer account issues. Minimum statistic catches ANY service node seeing reduced endpoint count."
PrivateLink,BytesProcessed (Endpoint),BytesProcessed,Anomaly Detection,GreaterThanUpperThreshold,300,3,2,P3-Medium,Throughput monitoring for cost analysis (data transfer charges) and identifying unused endpoints. Zero bytes over extended period (7+ days) indicates unused endpoint consuming unnecessary costs (~$7.50/month/AZ). Upper threshold anomaly detects unusual data transfer requiring investigation.
PrivateLink,RstPacketsSent,RstPacketsSent,Sum,> 100 RST packets,300,2,2,P2-High,"RST packets from endpoint service indicate application errors, timeouts, or resource exhaustion. Similar to NLB target resets but specific to PrivateLink services. Threshold 100 per 5 min for typical microservice traffic. Requires application-level investigation when triggered."
PrivateLink,NewConnections,NewConnections,Anomaly Detection,GreaterThanUpperThreshold,300,3,2,P3-Medium,"New connection pattern monitoring. Sudden spikes may indicate connection storm, retry loops, or security events. Sudden drops indicate upstream service degradation. Anomaly detection adapts to daily/weekly traffic patterns for shared services accessed by multiple accounts."
