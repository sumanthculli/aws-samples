Component,Alarm Name,Metric Name,Statistic,Threshold,Period (seconds),Evaluation Periods,Datapoints to Alarm,Severity,Reasoning
EKS Worker Node,Node CPU Utilization (Critical),node_cpu_utilization,Maximum,> 90%,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"Sustained 90%+ CPU causes application throttling, increased latency, potential pod evictions. Maximum statistic catches worst-case utilization. 2/2 datapoints (10 min sustained) confirms persistent CPU pressure requiring immediate node scaling or pod optimization. Container Insights metric from CloudWatch agent."
EKS Worker Node,Node CPU Utilization (Warning),node_cpu_utilization,Average,> 80%,300,3,3,P2-High,Average CPU 80%+ indicates node nearing capacity limits. Used for proactive scaling before hitting critical threshold. 3/3 datapoints (15 min) reduces false positives from brief CPU spikes during deployments. Triggers Horizontal Pod Autoscaler review or cluster autoscaler adjustment.
EKS Worker Node,Node Memory Utilization (Critical),node_memory_utilization,Maximum,> 90%,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"Memory pressure > 90% triggers Kubelet pod eviction. Unlike CPU (throttled), memory exhaustion causes OOMKills and pod terminations - service impact. Maximum statistic essential to catch any node approaching eviction threshold. 2/2 datapoints confirms persistent memory pressure requiring immediate intervention."
EKS Worker Node,Node Memory Utilization (Warning),node_memory_utilization,Average,> 85%,300,3,3,P2-High,Warning threshold at 85% (Kubernetes memory pressure threshold) provides advance notice before evictions begin. Average statistic over 15 min (3 periods) identifies sustained high memory usage vs. transient spikes. Enables proactive memory limit tuning or pod rescheduling before service impact.
EKS Worker Node,Node Disk Utilization (Critical),node_filesystem_utilization,Maximum,> 85%,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"85% disk utilization triggers Kubernetes disk pressure eviction. Node root filesystem stores image layers, container logs, EmptyDir volumes. Maximum statistic critical - even single node at 85% triggers evictions. 2/2 datapoints (10 min) confirms persistent disk pressure. Remediation: cordon, drain, replace node."
EKS Worker Node,Node Disk Utilization (Warning),node_filesystem_utilization,Maximum,> 75%,300,3,2,P3-Medium,"75% disk threshold for capacity planning. Provides buffer before hitting critical 85% eviction threshold. 2/3 datapoints reduces sensitivity for gradual disk growth vs. sudden exhaustion. Action: review log retention, image cleanup policies, EmptyDir volume usage, or provision nodes with larger EBS volumes."
