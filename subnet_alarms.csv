Component,Alarm Name,Metric Name,Statistic,Threshold,Period (seconds),Evaluation Periods,Datapoints to Alarm,Severity,Reasoning
Subnet,AvailableIPs (Critical),AvailableIPs (Custom Metric),Minimum,< 20 IPs,300,2,2,P1-Critical,"Subnet IP exhaustion prevents new resource launches (pods, EC2, Lambda ENIs). 20 IP threshold provides buffer for typical autoscaling operations. EKS node + pods require 10-20 IPs depending on instance type and CNI config. Minimum statistic ensures alarm triggers before complete exhaustion. Requires Lambda-based custom metric (no native CloudWatch metric)."
Subnet,UsedPercentage (Warning),UsedPercentage (Custom Metric),Maximum,> 90%,300,2,2,P2-High,"90% utilization provides limited buffer before exhaustion during rapid scaling events. Maximum statistic captures worst-case utilization. 2/2 datapoints ensures sustained high utilization vs. momentary spike. Action: add secondary CIDR, create additional subnets, or review IP allocation efficiency."
Subnet,UsedPercentage (Capacity Planning),UsedPercentage (Custom Metric),Maximum,> 75%,300,4,3,P3-Medium,"Capacity planning threshold at 75% provides advance notice for subnet expansion planning. 3/4 datapoints reduces sensitivity - intended for proactive capacity management, not immediate response. Enables architectural reviews and change request preparation before reaching critical thresholds."
